/* This is a macro to fix the problems of FIPS codes from some data sources that do not have all 5 digits
this macro program can easily be adjusted to fit with different cases of the problems you may encounter 
with minor adjustments. This mainly focused for governmental data sets that tend to create a variable for 
FIPS County and a seperate variable for FIPS STATE but do not leave leading zeros or store them as numbers

There are SAS Call Routines that I did not know about when I created this fix. However, this was a good exercise
in developing a macro solution to problems that I encountered across data sets.
